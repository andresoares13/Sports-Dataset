Approximately 1.9 million click log entries were grouped together over the 500 most popular queries, i.e., with the highest number of clicks. The `dataset.csv` file contains the list of queries and corresponding entities with clicks in the following format:

| Query   | Locale | Total Clicks | Results (Entity, (Clicks;Average Position)) |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| atalanta | pt     | 1592         | Atalanta-Italia-Team-Futebol-Q1886 (1560;1.01), Rui Patr√≠cio-Portugal-Player-Futebol-Q294980 (32;2.0) |

Where each entity contains the name, country, type of entity, sport and Wikidata ID.

Three different levels of relevance were established. The first level, which was the most relevant, represented entities that had between 100 and 75% of the total clicks for a query and was given a value of 3.
The range of the second level was between 74 and 50%, and was given a value of 2, while the range of the third level was between 49 and 25% and was given a value of 1. Any lower percentage of clicks was deemed irrelevant. The list is organized in the following format:

| Query;Locale   | QueryID | DocumentID | Relevance Score |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| academica;pt | 0     | Q243235         | 3 |
